I hadn't realized that GitHub's repositories also serve as web subdomains of their website if the repository names are formatted a certain way.  I also like how git automatically tracks new files as I expected that to require manual adding.

The biggest thing I have to remember is that there is a significant delay before changes are reflected on GitHub.  I'm not sure what else I need to be concious of because of my prior experience with version control.

I mainly felt relief because I hadn't expected the delay to be that long, but I'm pleased to now have some experience with a new web deployment application.

I did not have any real "aha" moments in this exercise, but I have never dealt first hand with version control that makes commits live on the web, so where were some moments of awe.

I did not need to consult other resources.  I did have an issue where the cloning of the curriculum materials got interrupted by a dropped Internet connection and GitHub's app did not know how to recover from that, but that was resolved first by attempting to remove the files manually in the terminal, then manually in the Windows Explorer.
