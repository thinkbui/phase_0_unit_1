## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The largest struggles I had thus far is time pressure from outside DBC and inconsistency in use between my Yahoo! e-mail and GMail accounts for login credentials.  The latter was caused by my use of my Yahoo! address in my application and early accounts setup before I knew DBC relies heavily on Google+.

git is an application that is local to your machine and just your machine that keeps track of changes to any files that you set it up to monitor so that you could undo changes if needed and resolve any edits you make at the same time that don't jive with each other.  GitHub is an online app that extends the desktop app keeping track of edits on the website as well and allowing others to help make needed changes.

All version control is is maintaining every committed save state of each file so that there is a record of all changes that are made and who made them so that conflicts could be resolved and rollbacks of edits can be easily done.

Developers use version control to take advantage of its audit trail and these other capabilities, especially when experimenting with edits that may or may not work, the latter possiblity requiring rollbacks to an earlier, good copy.  As someone who has had formal computer science education and work in software development as both an IT professional and a salesman of development tools, this makes perfect sense to me to use.

The concept makes sense to me as I have worked with it before; I'm just under time pressure to learn git/GitHub specifically, so it just feels overwhelming to me right now to set all of this up.
