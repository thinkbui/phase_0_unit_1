## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://thinkbui.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did enjoy breaking down the appearance of my three favorite sites, but after awhile it got to be kind of redundant since the layouts are so similar.  I also made the mistake of reusing a lot of the code from previous HTML/CSS exercises as I did not design those to be fluid, but I decided just to ditch the footer and add a second sidebar, which looks like they will do for now, and I suppose I could always reformat the template if needs change later on, just like any other website.
