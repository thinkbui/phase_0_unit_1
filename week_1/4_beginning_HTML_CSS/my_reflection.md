Because I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about the appearance of the page and focused on the required elements instead, the aesthetics are horrible.  I also did not monkey around with positioning of elements, but at least it is structured sequentially so that it is easy to attach id's to each element and move them around in later edits.

HTML doesn't have a lot of interactivity, so it severely limits what can be shown on a webpage without other languages and resources.

It was review to me, particularly when I spend most of my time reusing code or otherwise working from existing documents rather than build from scratch.

I did consult http://www.w3schools.com/css/ a little bit for ideas on what to use to make my page less annoying to look at.
