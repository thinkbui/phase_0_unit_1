Good morning fellow campers!

My name is Ian Bui and I am from the Twin Cites in Minnesota.  I hope to get to know each of you better of the next few months as we tackle the web development education together.  I tend to spend a lot of time on Facebook and, as a hockey fan, Gopher Puck Live, so you can look for me there.  I have Concrete Sequential thinking and Multimodal learning.

I had a crazy few weeks leading up to phase 0, so I need to take a break and sleep for a few hours, but I will take a look at your GitHub pages later today.  In the meantime, here are the links to mine:

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I kind of knew that their experiences so far would be somewhat similar to mine as we all are similar people in one way or another, but it is good for me to see on paper given that DBC still is way outside my comfort zone.  I also like how "taking a break" seems to have struck a chord as I was actually planning on taking Monday off to give my mind a rest before diving into week 2 curriculum.
