I couldn't figure out why my image caption span wasn't overlaying over the image with a bottom position of 0px, but I checked http://web.enavu.com/tutorials/making-image-overlay-caption-using-css/ and it turned I set position to relative when it needed to be absolute.

I have worked with the box model quite extensively before, but never felt completely comfortable with it.  I guess I never really grasped what happens when you mix absolute and relative positioning, so I tend to use one and stick with it.

Anything I used, I've used before.

I guess I want to do some more reading on positioning.

I enjoyed the problem solving in this exercise.

I didn't like how it was just a set of specific elements and properties, like the last exercise.  I tend to like building something that has a purpose, so creating a page that has a jumble of random elements doesn't easily capture my interest.
