# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
	* I've been aware of it at a high level for some time as a frequent smartphone user, but never saw it at a code level.  It makes perfect sense as browser window size varies more and more.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	* They have introduced a large number of small screens that view the web and forced web developers to design web pages around the tight window size.  Variation will continue to rise as many different types of web-capable devices, such as smart watches and glasses continue to come to market.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
	* Since blind people depend more on sound and touch, it is conceivable that current and future text-to-speech technologies could be built into websites to allow them to access the web.  Partially blind people may also need large text versions of webpages.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
	* Since I've seen a lot of HTML before, the only major area that's been introduced to me is the @media CSS.  I've heard of it in passing with respect to printing (i.e. "@media print"), but I've never delved into it myself and am excited to use the native HTML5/CSS3 functionality that I previously relied on Javascript to perform.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* Other than the files from Girl Develop It, I did not use any other resources.  The page looks good at my smartphone's resolution, though I did make a small change to the header and footer navbars by shrinking the text slightly so that the links still fit into a single line.
