# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	* I've seen the DOM explained before in my formal college education, so it's nothing new to me.  It makes it very easy to traverse the structure of the document when identifying problems or just elements needing editting.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	* Wordpress blogs have a lot more structure to it to accomodate more than one article on each page that each have their own headers and footers.  There's also code that is interpreted based on the OS/browser to make the site look consistent across all of them.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	* I have worked with them before when needing to fix poorly implemented webpages in order to view them or extract resources that I may want to borrow for my own purposes.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	* I didn't really have an aha moment, but I really only worked with the Elements and Resources tabs before, so I found it interesting to work with the other tabs, particularly when it comes to developing my own pages.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
