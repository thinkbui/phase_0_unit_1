Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	* Design and UX need to be on top of the increasingly diverse methods of access, particularly with the massively increasing volume of mobile communications.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	* With the responsive design, I was really excited to work with that and integrate it into my blog template so that the page would be fluid and alter itself to best fit the the window size, even for touchscreen smartphones.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	* The process I had in mind was to maintain the basic visual structure of the page since that is a proven design, but it got a little sticky when it came to the tablet and mobile implementations.  Since the left sidebar isn't doing much at this point, I decided that it could be hidden if the window became tablet size or smaller, but this can be altered later.  The right sidebar got moved to below the main content section at smartphone size.  In both situations, the main content section was adjusted appropriately.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	* I want a nav sidebar that automatically populates with every previous blog post.  When that is done, I could readjust the responsive design to position the nav links above the main content instead of hiding it completely.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	* Again I was already looking forward to the responsive design, but I did run into issues switching to fix-sized width sidebars when using the css calc() function, but that turned out to be needing spaces between the terms (i.e. "calc(100% - 300px)" vs. "calc(100%-300px)").
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* Besides calc(), none.
