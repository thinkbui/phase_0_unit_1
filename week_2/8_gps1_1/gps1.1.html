        <p>Pair Programming is essential at DBC's Phase 0 for all students. It solidifies the concept
        group collaboration, which is at the core of any professional development experience.

When more than one developer is working on a project, it is easy for them 
to interpret the requirements differently or create conflicting 
implementations.  When they are pair programming, they are constantly 
collaborating on what and how to code so they come away with the same 
understanding of what needs to be done, especially when working separately 
later on.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par2"><span class="opener">Promote Listening</span><br />
It is easy for one developer's ideas to dominate when coding a project.  
By programming in pairs and allowing one developer to provide direction 
while the other codes,that ensures that both developers' thoughts on the 
project are considered.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par3"><span class="opener">Promote Independent Thinking</span><br />
Without the discrete separation of driver and navigator roles, it's 
possible for developers to fall into a follower role where they defer 
their opinion to other developers.  Splitting the responsibilities 
between drivers and navigators and the dialog it creates prevents 
developers from passing over opportunities of providing their input.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par4"><span class="opener">Mirrors Professional Development Environments</span><br />
Large projects require multiple developers and multiple developers 
need coordination.  In these cases, it is necessary work together on 
programming for all the other reasons discussed.  Therefore this method 
of development is used in the professional environment to ensure quality 
work among more than one developer when several large parts of the project 
are in motion.</p>

Since this is essentially my first experience with Pair Programming with discrete roles of driver and navigator, it took getting used to for me and that was reflected in instructor feedback citing how it took half the initial session for me to assert myself as a navigator.  Interestingly I was working with someone who had the opposite problem where she likes to take control of all the tasks, so it was probably beneficial that we jumped into this with my being a navigator and her being a driver since we clearly would have been very comfortable in the reversed roles.<br />
As far as the technical aspect of this challege, we did run into issues with browser implementation and the Stypi interface interfering with HTML/CSS behavior on its preview panel.  Issues include font-family attributes not being inherited child elements from their parent elements and the same margin percentages providing different amounts of whitespace depending on the browser.  There are workarounds for this, such as using wrappers and explicitly declaring a font-family attribute to inherit.  Having worked as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst, I've seen first hand how different browsers and even different builds of the same browser could behave differently, so this seems to support the establishment of uniform standards where possible and good QA when not.</p>
