# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	* The biggest challenge was sticking to a schedule.  I have been out of a professional, full-time environment for a little while now, so it wasn't easy to stay disciplined.  I had planned on finishing everything, except for some work to be done for Pair Programming sessions, by Friday evening so that I could rest the whole weekend, but even accounting for a family emergency, I missed the goal by about a day.
* How will you combat that? 
	* The only way to combat that is to again work towards that this upcoming week by setting a schedule and following it as it is something that takes practice.
* What techniques will you try?
	* I think the best technique to try is the small habit approach, not so much with the coursework itself, but with the breaks for things like lunch.  If I could get into the habit of eating at roughly the same time each day instead of whenever it suits me, I think I could balance the rest of the time for the coursework.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	* The overall plan I have is to maintain focus.  I can get distracted very easily with our culture of overstimulation that I have unfortunately subscribed to, so I need to prove to myself that I can stay on task for key aspects of DBC like maintain a schedule.
