# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	* They make sense.  I have already been using some, but others I haven't used caused me to run into issues with my code without them.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	* Yes it does since it streamlines the development and modification by reducing "div-itis" that can make code difficult to read.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	* Yes and it actually came up in my GPS session.  These are common structural containers of a page, so it makes sense that they are standardized so that they are immediately accessible to developers like using a template rather than rebuild the framework each time.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	* Browsers may each have different default values for elements.  The reset.css file forces them to a common standard so that developers do not have to manually override each basic value for each and every browser.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	* I mainly use Chrome, but also use Firefox, IE, and Opera and have used others in the past, so I've seen how things could look different on different browsers for the same page.  It's bad if consistency is required for things like company branding, but some variation may be necessary to, say,  distinguish functionality of a website that may be available on some browsers and not others.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* GirlDevelopIt's slids on @font-face and reset.css weren't clear to me, so I referred to http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp and http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ for more information.  I also needed clarification on jumps to sections since I did not know container ID's could be used in HTML5 as I was only aware of older bookmarking standards before visiting http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14542592/html5-link-to-section.
